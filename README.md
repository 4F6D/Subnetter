It outputs the important Attributes for an IP-Adress and its target subnet. Works only for a CIDR range from /25 - /32

Just enter an IP for Exampe: 10.1.1.55 and the CIDR of /28 and you get the information about this specific subnet. Maybe useful for students I don't know.

Example: 10.1.1.55 /28

Output:
IP-Address: 10.1.1.55
Subnet-Mask: 255.255.255.240
Network-ID: 10.1.1.48
Broadcast-IP: 10.1.1.63
First Host-IP: 10.1.1.49
Last Host-IP: 10.1.1.62
CIDR: /28
Group-Size: 16
